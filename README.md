# LoggyMcLogface
This project was created for the Network Application Programming course. It is a customizable logger with an external configuration file. Cross-platform and follows SET-standards.
- Application was designed in Python version 3.
- No dependencies required.
- Highly configurable
- Persistent configuration stored in .ini file with instructions
- Logs are usually stored in this format: [DATE] [TIME] [IP] [LEVEL] [MESSAGE]
- Date is YYYY/MM/DD
- Time is HH:MM:SS
- Level can be: FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG and TRACE.

I also designed a test application to go with this tool and make sure the logging is proper.
